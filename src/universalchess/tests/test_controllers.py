"""Tests for the controllers module.

Tests cover:
- GameController abstract base class
- LocalController initialization and event routing
- RemoteController initialization and protocol detection
- ControllerManager switching and event routing

Test Approach:
- Mock GameManager to avoid actual game logic
- Test event routing and state transitions
- Verify controller switching behavior
