"""Tests for piece type re-selection in reverse Hand+Brain mode.

When a piece is "bumped" (lifted and replaced on the same square) in reverse
hand-brain mode, it selects the piece type. This test verifies that a second
bump changes the selection, and if a move has already been computed, the
engine recalculates for the new piece type.

Test Scenarios:
1. Re-selection during COMPUTING_MOVE phase (engine still thinking)
2. Re-selection during WAITING_EXECUTION phase (move already computed)
