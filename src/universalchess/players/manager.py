class PlayerManager:
    """Manages both players in a chess game.
    
    Each game has two players (White and Black). The PlayerManager:
    - Holds references to both players
    - Routes piece events to the current player
    - Routes move requests to the current player
    - Notifies both players of moves made
    - Manages player lifecycle (start/stop)
    
    All players receive piece events and submit moves via callback.
    The difference is how they process events:
    - Human: Forms move from lift/place, submits any move
    - Engine/Lichess: Has pending move, only submits if events match
    
    Example:
        # Setup
        white_player = HumanPlayer()
        black_player = create_engine_player(chess.BLACK, "stockfish")
        
        manager = PlayerManager(white_player, black_player)
        manager.set_move_callback(on_move)
        manager.set_pending_move_callback(on_pending_move)  # For LED display
        manager.start()
        
        # On each turn
        manager.request_move(board)
        
        # Route piece events
        manager.on_piece_event("lift", square, board)
        manager.on_piece_event("place", square, board)
        
        # When a move is made
        manager.on_move_made(move, board)
