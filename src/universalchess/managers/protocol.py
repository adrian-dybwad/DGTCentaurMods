# This project started as a fork of DGTCentaur Mods by EdNekebno
# ( https://github.com/EdNekebno/DGTCentaur )
#
# Manages player integrations, assistant management, and game callbacks.
# Protocol emulation (Millennium, Pegasus, Chessnut) is now handled by
# RemoteController in the controllers/ module.
#
# Player integrations are handled via the players/ module, which provides
# clean abstractions for different player types (Human, Engine, Lichess).
