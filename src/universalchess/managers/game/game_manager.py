# This script manages a chess game, passing events and moves back to the calling script with callbacks.
# The calling script is expected to manage the display using the centralized epaper service.
# Calling script initialises with subscribeGame(eventCallback, moveCallback, keyCallback)
# eventCallback feeds back events such as start of game, gameover
# moveCallback feeds back the chess moves made on the board
# keyCallback feeds back key presses from keys under the display
