# Player Base Class

#
# Abstract base class for all players. A player is an entity that makes
# moves in a chess game. Each game has two players (White and Black).
#
# All players receive piece events and submit moves via callback:
# - HumanPlayer: Constructs moves from piece events
# - EnginePlayer: Computes moves, piece events confirm execution
# - LichessPlayer: Receives moves from server, piece events confirm execution
#
# The game validates all submitted moves the same way.

    A player is an entity that makes moves in a chess game. The game
    has two players (White and Black), and on each turn the appropriate
    player provides a move.
    
    All players submit moves via the move_callback. The difference is
    how they determine what move to submit:
    
    - HumanPlayer: Constructs a move from piece events (lift A, place B)
    - EnginePlayer: Computes a move, then validates piece events match
    - LichessPlayer: Receives a move from server, validates piece events match
    
    Key Methods:
    - request_move(): Called when it's this player's turn
    - on_piece_event(): Called when a piece is lifted/placed on the board
    - on_move_made(): Notify that a move was made (by either player)
    - can_resign(): Whether this player can be resigned via the board
    
    Move Flow:
    1. request_move() is called when it's this player's turn
    2. on_piece_event() is called for each lift/place event
    3. Player determines a move and calls move_callback
    4. Game validates the move and executes it (or enters correction mode)
    
    Thread Safety:
    Players may be called from multiple threads. Implementations should
    ensure thread safety, especially for request_move() which may spawn
    background threads.
