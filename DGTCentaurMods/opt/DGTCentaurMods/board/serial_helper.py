# DGT Centaur Command Constants
# These commands are used to initialize and communicate with the DGT Centaur board
# Reference: Based on commands from eboard.py and board.py modules

# Address Detection Commands
DGT_SEND_VERSION = bytearray(b'\x4d')        # Request board version information
DGT_STARTBOOTLOADER = bytearray(b'\x4e')     # Hard reboot/reset command  
DGT_BUS_PING = bytearray(b'\x87\x00\x00\x07') # Bus mode ping to detect board address

# Serial Buffer Management Commands
DGT_BUS_SEND_CHANGES = bytearray(b'\x83')   # Request field change updates (clears buffer)
DGT_BUTTON_STATUS = bytearray(b'\x94')      # Check button states (clears buffer)

# LED Control Commands
DGT_LEDS_OFF = bytearray(b'\xb0\x00\x07\x00') # Turn all LEDs off (ledsOff() function)

# Sound Control Commands
DGT_POWER_ON_BEEP = bytearray(b'\xb1\x00\x08\x48\x08') # Power-on beep sound (beep(SOUND_POWER_ON))

# Other Available Sound Commands (for reference):
# SOUND_GENERAL: 0xb1 0x00 0x08 0x4c 0x08
# SOUND_FACTORY: 0xb1 0x00 0x08 0x4c 0x40  
# SOUND_POWER_OFF: 0xb1 0x00 0x0a 0x4c 0x08 0x48 0x08
# SOUND_WRONG: 0xb1 0x00 0x0a 0x4e 0x0c 0x48 0x10
# SOUND_WRONG_MOVE: 0xb1 0x00 0x08 0x48 0x08
