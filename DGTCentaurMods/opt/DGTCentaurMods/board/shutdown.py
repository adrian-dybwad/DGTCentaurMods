DGT Centaur Controller Sleep Hook

This script is called by stopDGTController.service during system shutdown
to send a sleep command to the DGT Centaur controller. This ensures the
controller powers down properly before the Raspberry Pi completes shutdown.

Installed by: DGTCentaurMods package
Service: /etc/systemd/system/stopDGTController.service

Can be tested independently: python3 board/shutdown.py
