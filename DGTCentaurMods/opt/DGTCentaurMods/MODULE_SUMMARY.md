## Key Design Patterns

1. **Singleton Pattern**: State objects, services, and managers use singletons for global access
2. **Observer Pattern**: State objects notify observers on changes (position, clock, game over)
3. **Facade Pattern**: AssistantManager hides assistant implementation details
4. **Strategy Pattern**: Controllers and players are interchangeable implementations
5. **Factory Pattern**: Engine and assistant creation functions
6. **Lazy Loading**: Widgets and database imports are deferred to speed startup

---

## Thread Safety Notes

- State objects are NOT thread-safe; callers must synchronize mutations
- Services own countdown/polling threads
- Display manager has a dedicated render thread
- GameManager uses a task queue for ordered I/O operations
- BleManager uses GLib mainloop for D-Bus events
